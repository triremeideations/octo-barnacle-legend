## Introduction

It is a fantasy adventure/epic series based loosely on Igbo mythology: A tale of spirits, oracles, gods and mortals; of their lives, lies, loves and lore.

## Installation

There is no installation needed. The game is played in-browser.

## Usage and Controls

The user is to play the game using keyboard input of the Arrow Keys for movement, and the W, A, S and D keys for special moves which can be made in
combination with the arrow keys.

For mobile devices, a virtual keyboard has been implemented, and aims to be a means of availing almost similar control via touchscreen input. However, the best experience is to be obtained on a physical keyboard.

## Version

This is an alpha-version, and the first iteraion of the game.
It is the first ever deployment intended only for evaluation purposes.
